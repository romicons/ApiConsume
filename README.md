<p align="center"> Welcome to a unique experience in the vast universe of A Song of ❄️ Ice and 🔥 Fire.</p>

<p>This attractive and innovative web app invites you to dive deeper than ever into the world created by George R.R. Martin. Connecting to the 'GoT-Data' project, hosted on <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Mockapi-%233b657a">, this application generates a detailed digital encyclopedia of your favorite characters, offering you a fascinating window through which to explore the intrigues, passions, and secrets that make up the fabric of Westeros and beyond. </p>

<p>Equipped with all the basic functionalities of a <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CRUD-%233b657a"> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, GoT Data invites you not only to explore the vast world of A Song of Ice and Fire but also to actively contribute to it by adding, editing, or deleting information according to your knowledge and preferences.</p>

<h2 align="center">Create</h2>

<p>Using the <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/POST-%233b657a"> method, you will be able to expand this encyclopedia by adding both 🏠 Houses and 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Characters. To create new <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Houses-%23f0f5e1">, you will need to provide the following information: </p>

<ul>
  
🏷️ Name.

<ul>
  
🏷️ Name.

<h2 align="center">Read</h2>

<p>Using the <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GET-%233b657a"> method, you'll be able to access all the information stored in the 🌐 API. You can initially get a general overview of all the 🏰 houses stored, then navigate specifically to access each of them.

It's advisable to review carefully before making permanent deletions.</p>
